Introduction
============

Amulet is a Lua-based toolkit for experimenting with interactive
graphics and audio. It provides a cross-platform API
for drawing graphics, playing audio and responding to user input, and a
command-line interpretter for running Amulet scripts.

It tries to be simple to use, but without making too many assumptions
about how you want to use it.

Amulet currently runs on the following platforms:

-   Windows 7+ (32 bit)
-   Mac OS X 10.6+ (64 bit)
-   Linux (32 and 64 bit)
-   HTML5
-   iOS (armv7 and arm64)

Support for Android will be added at some point as well.

How to use this document
========================

If you have some programming experience, but are
new to Lua then the [Lua primer](#lua-primer) should
bring you up to speed.

The [quickstart tutorial](#quickstart) introduces basic
concepts and walks you through
drawing things on screen, playing audio and responding to user
input.

It is suggested that new users go through the tutorial first.
The rest of the document can then be used as a reference,
dipping into sections as needed.

If you see a function argument with brackets around it
in a function signature, then that argument is optional.
