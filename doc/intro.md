Introduction
============

Amulet is a Lua-based toolkit for experimenting with interactive
graphics and audio. It provides a cross-platform API
for drawing graphics, playing audio and responding to user input, and a
command-line interpretter for running Amulet scripts.

It tries to be simple to use, but without making too many assumptions
about how you want to use it.

Amulet currently runs on the following platforms:

-   Windows 7+ (32 bit)
-   Mac OS X 10.6+ (64 bit)
-   Linux (32 and 64 bit)
-   iOS (armv7 and arm64)
-   HTML5

Support for Android will be added at some point as well.

How to use this document
========================

If you're mainly interested in drawing simple 2D graphics, playing audio
and reacting to keyboard and mouse input then the [quickstart tutorial](#quickstart)
should be enough to get you going.

The sections after the tutorial go into more detail about
advanced usage and may require a bit of knowledge about modern
computer graphics.

The [API reference](#api-reference) contains detailed documentation
for all the Lua functions available in Amulet.
