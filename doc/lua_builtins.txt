## Lua Builtins

This sections covers a few of the more commonly used Lua builtin functions.
For the full list please refer to the [Lua manual](lua_manual.html)

### collectgarbage() {.func-def}

Perform a full garbage collection cycle.

### require(module) {.func-def}

Loads a module. `module` should be the name of a lua file in the same directory
as the file calling `require`, without the ".lua" suffix. If the module has not
been loaded before, then the module is run, its return value cached, and
returned by `require`. Otherwise the previously cached value is returned by
`require`.
