## Playing audio

### am.play(source, loop, pitch, gain)

Returns an action that plays audio.
Like any other action it needs to be attached to a scene
node that's connected to a window to run.

`source` can either be the name of a ".ogg" file
or a seed generated by the sfxr tool (there's an online
version of that tool in the examples list of the [online editor](http://www.amulet.xyz/editor.html)).

`loop` can be `true` or `false`.

`pitch` is a multiplier applied to the playback speed.
1.0 mean play at the original speed. 2.0 means play
swice as fast and 0.5 means play at half the original speed.

`gain` should be between 0 and 1.
