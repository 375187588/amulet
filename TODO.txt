- Detect and handle cyclic module imports

- Add context to errors that occur in rendering (e.g. missing uniform
  values). This would require the lua file/line to be recorded when nodes
  are created. Assess the performance tradeoff of doing this.

- Make vecs and mats readonly. Actually this makes some things quite
  awkward, such as tweening a vector's components separately.
  In cases where vec updates would be problematic (e.g. with views
  or matrix columns), we could return readonly vecs, which are the
  same as normal vecs, but have a modified metatable.

- Look at integrating luasocket for networking support (what about html
  backend?).
