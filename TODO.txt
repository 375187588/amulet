- Detect and handle cyclic module imports

- Distinguish between invalid field names and invalid field value types
  in error messages generated by am_scene_node_newindex
  (e.g. try setting an invalid field on a scene node - the system reports
  that it can't set the field to the particular type - it should
  report that the field is invalid).

- Add context to errors that occur in rendering (e.g. missing uniform
  values). This would require the lua file/line to be recorded when nodes
  are created. Assess the performance tradeoff of doing this.

- Remove am_ prefixes on source file names.

- Make vecs and mats readonly.

- Remove specialized index+newindex on transform nodes and replace
  with single field (e.g. rotation for rotate, position for translate,
  scaling for scale, etc).

- Look at integrating luasocket for networking support (what about html
  backend?).

- Quaternions
