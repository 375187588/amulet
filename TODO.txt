- Detect and handle cyclic module imports

- Add context to errors that occur in rendering (e.g. missing uniform
  values). This would require the lua file/line to be recorded when nodes
  are created. Assess the performance tradeoff of doing this.

- Remove am_ prefixes on source file names.

- Make vecs and mats readonly.

- Look at integrating luasocket for networking support (what about html
  backend?).
